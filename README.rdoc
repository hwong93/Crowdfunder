CrowdFundr is a web app that is supposed to be a clone of KickStarter. This was a bitmaker group project. Users can select different donations for rewards for projects that they want to support. This project was supposed to help solidify multi-forms, validations, models, controllers and Javascript/AJAX concepts. 

==Things to add:
1. Definitely need to clean up the CSS
2. Allow users to donate a custom amount but also receive the reward it falls into
